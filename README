Bottle-based simple static file paste server.

* Highlighting done via `highlight` (http://www.andre-simon.de/)

* Password protected submission and deletion (weak, md5), viewing public

* Three interfaces:
    1) HTML form located at /
    2) Simple form located at /cmd
    3) Easy command line pasting via `curl .. /cmd`, with helper script `paste_cmd`
        e.g.: cat ~/file.c | paste_cmd c http://localhost

* All dependencies are contained here, bootstrap and jquery - I had plans more JS.
* All pastes are kept in pastes/PASTE-* directories

* There is also an interface to delete pastes
